# Handling forms and user input with React

This repository contains an exercise project created as part of a React learning course. The initial commit is code provided by the course, and I will be adding my own changes as I progress. This project is a hands-on practice tool and not intended for any production use â€” it's simply a playground for learning and improving my skills in React and related technologies.
